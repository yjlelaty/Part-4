  <p>The Syrian revolution emerged as part of the broader Arab Spring movement that swept through the Middle East in 2011. Across the region, oppressed populations rose up against decades of dictatorship, corruption, and repression. In Syria, the call for freedom resonated deeply after nearly half a century of authoritarian rule under the Assad family. Yet what began as peaceful protests calling for reform was met with brutal, indiscriminate violence by the regime.</p>

  <p>In the city of Daraa, a small group of children was arrested and tortured for writing anti-government graffiti. When families and townspeople gathered to demand the children's release, security forces opened fire on the crowd, killing and injuring civilians. This merciless response was a warning that the Assad regime would tolerate no dissent. Instead of addressing grievances, the government escalated the violence, deploying tanks, mass arrests, snipers, and widespread torture to crush demonstrations across the country.</p>

  <p>Entire neighborhoods were besieged, cut off from food, water, and medicine as collective punishment for opposing the regime. Protesters, journalists, medics, and even bystanders were subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial killings. The Syrian government's brutality towards its own people was systematic, deliberate, and devastating, aiming not just to silence opposition, but to terrorize an entire nation into submission.</p>

  <p>Faced with such relentless repression, many Syrians chose to take up arms, not out of ideology, but out of survival. The revolution evolved from peaceful protests into a full-fledged uprising. The courage of the Syrian people, standing unarmed against tanks and artillery, became a symbol of resilience and the universal longing for dignity and freedom. The origins of the Syrian revolution are rooted not only in political demands but in the human spiritâ€™s refusal to accept injustice, no matter how brutal the consequences.</p>
