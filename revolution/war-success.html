  <p>What began as peaceful demonstrations against the Assad regime rapidly escalated into a brutal armed conflict. As the government continued its violent crackdowns, local militias formed across the country to protect protesters and communities. These early fighters, often civilians with minimal military training, became the foundation of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and other resistance movements.</p>

  <p>Throughout 2012 and 2013, rebel forces achieved significant victories, capturing large parts of northern and eastern Syria, as well as neighborhoods within major cities like Aleppo, Homs, and Idlib. The unity and determination of the rebels, driven by a desire for freedom and justice, allowed them to resist a well-equipped and ruthless government military. However, the conflict quickly became more complex with the rise of extremist groups, foreign interventions, and shifting alliances.</p>

  <p>Despite facing heavy aerial bombardments, sieges, and chemical attacks by regime forces, the opposition maintained control over large swaths of territory for several years. Cities like Aleppo became powerful symbols of resistance but also sites of devastating humanitarian catastrophes. Rebel fighters showed resilience, organizing local councils and schools even amidst war, demonstrating their commitment to building a better Syria beyond the battlefield.</p>

  <p>As the war dragged on, international actors like Russia, Iran, the United States, and others became heavily involved, each backing different sides. Russian military intervention in 2015 marked a turning point in favor of the Assad regime. Relentless airstrikes helped government forces recapture critical areas, including eastern Aleppo in 2016, dealing a significant blow to the opposition's momentum.</p>

  <p>By the end of major fighting in 2018, most major urban centers were back under Assad’s control, but at an immense human cost. Entire cities were reduced to rubble, and millions of Syrians were displaced internally or forced into exile. Although the war entered a period of relative stalemate, with pockets of opposition remaining in places like Idlib Province, the spirit of resistance endured in many parts of the country.</p>

  <p>In a historic turn of events, on December 8, 2024, the Assad regime collapsed following a major offensive launched by opposition forces. The operation was spearheaded by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and supported mainly by the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army. After over a decade of tyranny, brutal repression, and civil war, the Syrian people witnessed the downfall of the regime that had oppressed them for generations. This victory marked not just the end of a dictatorship, but the beginning of a new and hopeful chapter in Syria's history—a chapter shaped by the sacrifices of those who fought tirelessly for freedom, dignity, and justice.</p>
